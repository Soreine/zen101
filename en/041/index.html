    <h1>Joshu's Zen</h1>
<p>Joshu began the study of Zen when he was sixty years old and continued until he was eighty, when he realized Zen.</p>
<p>He taught from the age of eighty until he was one hundred and twenty. A student once asked him: ‘If I haven't anything in my mind, what shall I do?'</p>
<p>Joshu replied: ‘Throw it out.'</p>
<p>'But if I haven't anything how on I throw it out?' continued the questioner. 'Well,' said Joshu, 'then carry it out.’</p>
