    <h1>The True Path</h1>
    <p>Just before Ninakawa passed away the Zen master Ikkyu visited him. 'Shall I lead you on Ikkyu asked. Ninakawa replied: 'I came here alone and I go alone. What help could you be to me?'</p>
    <p>Ikkyu answered: 'If you think you really come and go, that is your delusion. Let me show you the path on which there is no coming and no going.'</p>
    <p>With his words Ikkyu had revealed the path so clearly that Ninakawa smiled and passed away.</p>
