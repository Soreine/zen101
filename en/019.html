    <h1>The First Principle</h1>
    <p>When one goes to Obaku temple in Kyoto one sees carved over the gate the words ' The First principle '. The letters are unusually large, and those who appreciate calligraphy always admire them as being a masterpiece. They were drawn by Kosen two hundred years ago.</p>
    <p>When the master drew them he did so on paper, from which workmen made the larger carving in wood. As Kosen sketched the letters a bold pupil was with him who had made several gallons of ink for the calligraphy and who never failed to criticize his master's work.</p>
    <p>That is not good,' he told Kosen after the first effort.</p>
    <p>'How is that one?'</p>
    <p>'Poor. Worse than before,' pronounced the pupil.</p>
    <p>Kosen patiently wrote one sheet after another until eighty-four First Principles had accumulated, still without the approval of the pupil.</p>
    <p>Then, when the young man stepped outside for a few moments, Kosen thought: 'Now is my chance to escape his keen eye,' and he wrote hurriedly, with a mind free from distraction: â€˜The First principle.'</p>
    <p>'A masterpiece,' pronounced the pupil.</p>
