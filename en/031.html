    <h1>Everything is Best</h1>
    <p>When Banzan was walking through a market he overheard a conversation between a butcher and his customer. 'Give me the best piece of meat you have,' said the customer.</p>
    <p>'Everything in my shop is the best,' replied me butcher. "You cannot find here any piece of meat that is not the best.' At these words Banzan became enlightened.</p>
