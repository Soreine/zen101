    <h1>Tasui's Vinegar</h1>
    <p>Tosui was the Zen master who left the formalism of temples to live under a bridge with beggars. When he was getting very old, a friend helped him to earn his living without begging. He showed Tosui how to collect rice and manufacture vinegar from it and Tosui did this until he passed away.</p>
    <p>While Tosui was making vinegar, one of the beggars gave him a picture of the Buddha. Tosui hung it on the wall of his hut and put a sign beside it. The sign read:</p>
    <p>â€˜Mr. Amida Buddha: This little loom is quite narrow. I can let you remain as a transient. But don't think I am asking you to help me to be reborn in your paradise.'</p>
