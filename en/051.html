    <h1>Sour Miso</h1>
    <p>The cook monk Dairyo, at Bankei's monastery, decided that he would take good care of his old teacher's health and give him only fresh miso, a paste of soy beans mixed with wheat and yeast that often ferments. Bankei, noticing that he was being served better miso than his pupils, asked: 'Who is the cook today?'</p>
    <p>Dairyo was sent before him. Bankei learned that according to his age and position he should eat only fresh miso. So he said to the cook: Then you think I shouldn't eat at all.' With this he entered his room and locked the door.</p>
    <p>Dairyo, sitting outside the door, asked his teacher’s pardon. Bankei would not answer. For seven days Dairyo sit outside and Bankei within.</p>
    <p>Finally in desperation an adherent called loudly to Bankei: 'You may be all right old teacher, but this young disciple here has to eat. He cannot go without food forever!’</p>
    <p>At that Bankei opened the door. He was smiling. He told Dairyo: 'I insist on eating the same food as the least of my followers. When you become the teacher I do not want you to forget this.'</p>
