    <h1>Just Go to Sleep</h1>
<p>Gasan was sitting at the bedside of Tekisui three days before his teacher's passing. Tekisui had already chosen him as his successor.</p>
<p>A temple recently had burned and Gasan was busy rebuilding the structure. Tekisui asked him: 'What are you going to do when you get the temple rebuilt?'</p>
<p>'When your sickness is over we want you to speak there,’ said Gasan. 'Suppose I do not live until then?'</p>
<p>‘Then we will get someone else,' replied Gasan.</p>
<p>Suppose you cannot find anyone?' continued Tekisui.</p>
<p>Gasan answered loudly: 'Don't ask such foolish questions. Just go to sleep.'</p>
