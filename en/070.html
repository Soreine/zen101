    <h1>The Most Valuable Thing in the World</h1>
    <p>Sozan, a Chinese Zen master, was asked by a student: 'What is the most valuable thing in the world?' The master replied: The head of a dead cat.’</p>
    <p>'Why is the head of a dead cat the most valuable thing in the world?' inquired the student. Sozan replied: ‘Because no one can name its price.’</p>
