    <h1>The Gates of Paradise</h1>
    <p>A soldier named Nobushige came to Hakuin, and asked: ‘Is there really a paradise and a hell?'</p>
    <p>'Who are you? ' Inquired Hakuin.</p>
    <p>‘I am a samurai,' the warrior replied.</p>
    <p>‘You, a soldier!’ exclaimed Hakuin. 'What kind of ruler would have you as his guard? Your face looks like that of a beggar.'</p>
    <p>Nobushige became so angry that he began to draw his sword, but Hakuin continued: 'So you have a sword! Your weapon is probably much too dull to cut off my head.'</p>
    <p>As Nohushige drew his sword Hakuin remarked: ‘Here open the gates of hell!’</p>
    <p>At these words the samurai, perceiving the master's discipline, sheathed his sword and bowed. 'Here open the gates of paradise,' said Hakuin.</p>
