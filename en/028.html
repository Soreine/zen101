    <h1>Open Your Own Treasure House</h1>
    <p>Daiju visited the master Baso in China. Baso asked: 'What do you seek?' 'Enlightenment,' replied Daiju.</p>
    <p>'You have your own treasure house. Why do you search outside?' Baso asked. Daiju inquired : 'Where is my treasure house?'</p>
    <p>Baso answered: 'What you me asking me is your treasure house.'</p>
    <p>Daiju was enlightened! Ever after he urged his friends:</p>
    <p>'Open your own treasure house and use those treasures.'</p>
