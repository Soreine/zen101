    <h1>The Giver Should be Thankful</h1>
    <p>While Seisetsu was the master of Engaku in Kamakura he required larger quarters, since those in which he was teaching were overcrowded. Umezu Seibei, a merchant of Edo, decided to donate five hundred pieces of gold called ryo toward the construction of a more commodious school. This money he brought to the teacher.</p>
    <p>Seisetsu said: 'All right. I will take it.'</p>
    <p>Umezu gave Seisetsu the sack of gold, but he was dissatisfied with the attitude of the teacher. One might live a whole year on three ryo, and the merchant had not even been thanked for five hundred.</p>
    <p>'In that sack are five hundred ryo,' hinted Umezu. "You told me that before,' replied Seisetsu.</p>
    <p>'Even if I am a wealthy merchant, five hundred ryo is a lot of money,' said Umezu. ‘Do you want me to thank you for it?' asked Seisetsu.</p>
    <p>"You ought to,' replied Umezu.</p>
    <p>'Why should I?' inquired Seisetsu. ‘The giver should be thankful.'</p>
