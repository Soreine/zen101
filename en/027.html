    <h1>The Voice of Happiness</h1>
    <p>After Bankei had passed away, a blind man who lived near the master's temple told a friend: 'Since I am blind, I cannot watch a person's face, so I must judge his character by the sound of his voice. Ordinarily when I hear someone congratulate another upon his happiness or success, I also hear a secret tone of envy. When condolence is expressed for the misfortune of another. I hear pleasure and satisfaction as if the one condoling was really glad there was something left to gain in his own world.</p>
    <p>'In all my experience however, Bankei's voice was always sincere. Whenever he expressed happiness, I heard nothing but</p>
    <p>happiness, and whenever he expressed sorrow, sorrow was all I heard.'</p>
