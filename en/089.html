    <h1>Zen Dialogue</h1>
    <p>Zen teachers train their young pupils to express themselves. Two Zen temples; each had a child protégé. One child going to obtain vegetables each morning would meet the other on the way.</p>
    <p>'Where are you going?' asked the one.</p>
    <p>'I am going wherever my feet go.' the other responded.</p>
    <p>This reply puzzled the first child who went to his teacher for help.</p>
    <p>‘Tomorrow morning,' the teacher told him, 'when you meet that little fellow, ask him the same question. He will give you the same answer, and then you ask him: "Suppose have no feet, then where are you going!" That will fix him.'</p>
    <p>The children met again the following morning. 'Where are you going?' asked the first child. ‘I am going wherever the wind blows,' answered the other.</p>
    <p>This again nonplussed the youngster, who took his defeat to his teacher.</p>
    <p>'Ask him where he is going if there is no wind,' suggested the teacher.</p>
    <p>The next day the children met a third time.</p>
    <p>'Where are you going?' asked the first child.</p>
    <p>‘I am going to market to buy vegetables,' the other replied.</p>
