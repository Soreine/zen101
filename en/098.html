    <h1>Non-Attachment</h1>
    <p>Kitano Gempo, abbot of Eihei temple was ninety-two years old when he passed away in the year 1933. He endeavored his whole life not to be attached to anything. As a wandering mendicant when he was twenty he happened to meet a traveler who smoked tobacco. As they walked together down a mountain road they stopped under a tree to rest. The traveler offered Kitano a smoke, which he accepted, as he was very hungry at the time.</p>
    <p>'How pleasant this smoking is,' he commented. The other gave him an extra pipe and tobacco and they parted.</p>
    <p>Kitano felt: â€˜Such pleasant things may disturb meditation. Before this goes too far, I will stop now.' So he threw the smoking outfit away.</p>
    <p>When he was twenty-three years old he studied I-King, the profoundest doctrine of the universe. It was winter at the time and he needed some heavy clothes. He wrote to his teacher, who lived a hundred miles away, telling him of his need, and gave the letter to a traveler to deliver. Almost the whole winter passed and neither answer nor clothes arrived. So Kitano resorted to the prescience of I-King, which also teaches the art of divination, to determine whether or not his letter had miscarried. He found that this had been the case. A letter afterwards from his teacher made no mention of clothes.</p>
    <p>'If I perform such accurate determinative work with I-King, I may neglect my meditation,' felt Kitano. So he gave up this</p>
    <p>marvelous teaching and never resorted to its powers again.</p>
    <p>When he was twenty-eight he studied Chinese calligraphy and poetry. He grew so skilful in these arts that his teacher praised him. Kitano mused: 'If I don't stop now, I'll be a poet not a Zen teacher.' So he never wrote another poem.</p>
