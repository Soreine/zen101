    <h1>Flower Shower</h1>
    <p>Subhuti was Buddha's disciple. He was able to understand the potency of emptiness, the viewpoint that nothing exists accept in its relationship of subjectivity and objectivity.</p>
    <p>One day Subhuti, in a mood of sublime emptiness was sitting under a tree. Flowers began to fall about him.</p>
    <p>'We are praising you for your discourse on emptiness,' the gods whispered to him. â€˜But I have not spoken of emptiness,' said Subhuti.</p>
    <p>'You have not spoken of emptiness, we have not heard emptiness,' responded the gods. This is the true emptiness.' And blossoms showered upon Subhuti as rain.</p>
