    <h1>Inch Time Foot Gem</h1>
    <p>A lord asked Takuan, a Zen teacher to suggest how he might pass the time. He felt his day very long attending his office</p>
    <p>and sitting stiffly to receive the homage of others.</p>
    <p>Takuan wrote eight Chinese characters and gave them to the man:</p>
    <p>Not twice this day</p>
    <p>Inch time foot gem</p>
    <p>This day will not come again.</p>
    <p>Each minute is worth a priceless gem.</p>
