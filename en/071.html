    <h1>Learning to be Silent</h1>
    <p>The pupils of the Tendai School used to study meditation before Zen entered Japan. Four of them who were intimate friends promised one another to observe seven days of silence.</p>
    <p>On the first day all were silent Their meditation had begun auspiciously, but when night came and the oil-lamps were growing dim one of the pupils could not help exclaiming to a servant: 'Fix those lamps.'</p>
    <p>The second pupil was surprised to hear the first one talk. 'We are not supposed to say a word,' he remarked. 'You two are stupid. Why did you talk?' asked the third.</p>
    <p>â€˜I am the only one who has not talked,' muttered the fourth pupil.</p>
