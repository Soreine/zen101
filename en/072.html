    <h1>The Blockhead Lord</h1>
    <p>Two Zen teachers Daigu and Gudo, were invited to visit a lord. Upon arriving, Gudo said to the lord: 'You are wise by nature and have an inborn ability to learn Zen.'</p>
    <p>'Nonsense,' said Daigu â€˜Why do you flatter this blockheads? He may be a lord, but he doesn't know anything of Zen.' So, instead of building a temple for Gudo the lord built it for Daigu and studied Zen with him.</p>
