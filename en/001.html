    <h1>A Cup of Tea</h1>
    <p>Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era (1868-1912) received a university professor who came to inquire about Zen.</p>
    <p>Nan-in saved tea. He poured his visitor's cup full, and then kept on pouring.</p>
    <p>The professor watched the overflow until he no longer could restrain himself. 'It is overfull. No more will go in!'</p>
    <p>‘Like this cup,' Nan-in said. ‘You are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup? '</p>
