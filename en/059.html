    <h1>Soldiers of Humanity</h1>
    <p>Once a division of the Japanese army was engaged in I sham battle, and some of the officers found it necessary to make their headquarters in Gasan's temple.</p>
    <p>Gasan told his cook: 'Let the officers have only the same simple fare we eat.â€™</p>
    <p>This made the army men angry, as they were used to very differential treatment. One came to Gasan and said: 'Who do you think we are? We are soldiers, sacrificing our lives for our country. Why don't you treat us accordingly?'</p>
    <p>Gasan answered sternly: 'Who do you think we are? We are soldiers of humanity aiming to save all sentient beings.'</p>
