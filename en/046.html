    <h1>How Grass and Trees Become Enlightened</h1>
    <p>During the Kamkura period, Shinkan studied Tendai six years and then studied Zen seven years; then he went to China and contemplated Zen for thirteen years more.</p>
    <p>When he returned to Japan many desired to interview him and asked obscure questions. But when Shinkan received visitors, which was infrequently, he seldom answered their questions.</p>
    <p>One day a fifty-year-old student of enlightenment said to Shinkan: 'I have studied the Tendai school of thought since I was a little boy, but one thing in it I cannot understand. Tendai claims that even the grass and trees will become enlightened. To me this seems very strange.'</p>
    <p>'Of what use is it to discuss how grass and trees become enlightened?’ asked Shinkan. The question is how you yourself can become so. Did you ever consider that!'</p>
    <p>‘I never thought of it in that way,' marveled the old man. Then go home and think it over,' finished Shinkan.</p>
